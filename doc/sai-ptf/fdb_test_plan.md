# Test Configuration

For the test configuration, please refer to the file 
  - [Config_t0](./config_data/config_t0.md)
  
**Note. All the tests will be based on the configuration above, if any additional configuration is required, it will be specified in the Test case.**

# Test Execution

# Test Execution

## Common Test Data/Packet
In this FDB test, the example packet structure is below.
- Simple L2 packet
   ```python
    simple_udp_packet(eth_dst=dmac,
                      eth_src=smac)
   ```
- VLAN
  ```Python
    simple_udp_packet(eth_dst=dmsc,
                      eth_src=smac,
                      vlan_vid=lvlan_id)
  ```

  **Note. If need other kinds of packets, they will be added to the test case/group respectively.**
